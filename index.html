		<p>Hello! Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Isuru Vithanaarchchige. I am a 21 year old student studying at the University of Toronto Mississauga. I am double majoring in Communication, Culture, Information and Technology, and Technology, Code, and Society. I have a variety of passions, but I believe my greatest passion is visual creativity. Before I started university I thought I was a math and science person only, any visually creative task was impossible for me. One day after a terrible math test, I decided to draw a character on my laptop, and ever since that day, I kept drawing and opened up to other visually creative hobbies. After many months of practice, I still have lots to learn, but opening myself to this passion has allowed me to accomplish feats like making this website entirely with my own original art and designs. I love being creative ever since I opened my mind to it, and I'd love for more people that think like I used to, to realize they can be creative too. If I had to give one piece of advice to someone, I would tell them: "Just cause you gave up on drawing after one failed attempt doesn't mean you can't draw, it just means you have to try harder."
